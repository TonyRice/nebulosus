## Nebulosus

Nebulosus a **distributed key-value store** utilizing the [Evaporation Protocol](https://evaporation.network/protocol).
It is powered by [Hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast), [MapDB](https://github.com/jankotek/mapdb/), 
and [jsync.io](https://github.com/TonyRice/jsync.io). 

### Why was it created?
It was created for a simple need for a scalable key-value store with the ability to persist data globally in a P2P manner. It
accomplishes this by implementing the [Evaporation Protocol](https://evaporation.network/protocol). Which was actually created
because of this software :D.

Nebulosus also provides a simple Java API to make it easy to interact with the
[Evaporation Protocol](https://evaporation.network/protocol). The Evaporation Protocol allows you to communicate securely
using IPFS and strong cryptography.

NOTE: This project is a work in progress.
