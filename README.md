## Nebulosus

Nebulosus a distributed key-value store utilizing the [Evaporation Protocol](https://evaporation.network/protocol) for persistence.
It is powered by [Hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast), [MapDB](https://github.com/jankotek/mapdb/), 
and [jsync.io](https://github.com/TonyRice/jsync.io). 

### Why was it created?
It was created to provide a powerful and scalable key-value store with the ability to persist data globally. It
accomplishes this by implementing the [Evaporation Protocol](https://evaporation.network/protocol).

Nebulosus also providers a simple Java API to make it easy to interact with the
[Evaporation Protocol](https://evaporation.network/protocol).

NOTE: This project is a work in progress.
